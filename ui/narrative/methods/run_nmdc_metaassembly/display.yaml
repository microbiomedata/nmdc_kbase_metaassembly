    <p>
    This is a KBase implementation of the JGI Metagenome Assembly Pipeline. From a set of paired-end reads, it will filter, correct, and assemble them through the steps described below into an Assembly object. 
    Full documentation on the workflow can be found at the <a href="https://nmdc-workflow-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">NMDC Read the Docs site</a>.
    This will also generate a report containing several files generated throughout the quality control and assembly process.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Note that this pipeline currently only supports paired-end Illumina reads!</b> If you have other data you would like to use, please <a href="https://kbase.us/contact-us">contact us</a>.

    <h3>Computational steps</h3>
    These steps are detailed below.

    <p>This is an automated pipeline, with steps and parameters fixed in place. A diagram of the workflow is shown above.  These steps are detailed below.
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>BBtools error correction</b> This uses bbcms in BBttols to perform error correction.  It also reformats the reads and computes readlengths.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Version:</b> 38.90
            <p>
            <p>
                <b>Parameters:</b> -Xmx105G} mincount=2 highcountfraction=0.6 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>SPAdes</b> This is the tool used to assemble the reads into contigs and scaffolds. SPAdes is designed to assemble shotgun genomic and metagenomic reads, as used in the rest of this pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Version:</b> 3.15.0
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Parameters:</b> --only-assembler -k 33,55,77,99,127 --meta -t 32 -m 2000
                <br>
                Note that this invokes metaSPAdes with k-mers values of 33, 55, 77, 99, and 127. A caveat here is that if your reads (after filtering and correcting) have an average length that's less than any of those k-mer values, that k-mer value won't be used. E.g., if your corrected reads have an average length of 100, the k=127 pass will be skipped.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>BBTools stats.sh</b> This constructs assembly statistics from the output of SPAdes. This step also uses samtools to sort and index the alignments.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Version:</b> BBTools version 38.90

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>BBMap</b> This tool builds a coverage map of reads mapped onto the finalized assembly and generates coverage statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Version:</b> BBTools version 38.90
